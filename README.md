# potree-navvis
quick prototype showing forge viewer cad plus navvis scans... with caveats


Please do the following:

1. disable webGL2 - needed because pointcloud material is still webGL1 shader (sorry, to be fixed)
2. disable 'web security' - this is to 'work around' the CORS restriction on access potree files directly from Navvis webservers.
